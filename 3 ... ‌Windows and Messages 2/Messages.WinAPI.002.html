                    <td>This message pops up right when your window is getting ready to exist, just after it's been created. Think of it as the "setup" notification.</td>
                    <td>This is your go-to spot to set up all the initial stuff for your window: load any pictures or sounds, kick off timers, or get your app's starting game pieces ready.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>WM_DESTROY</code></td>
                    <td>Your window is officially signing off! This message hits when the window is being totally removed, like when a user clicks the 'X' or your code explicitly destroys it.</td>
                    <td>When you get this, it's the signal to gracefully shut down. Most importantly, call <code>PostQuitMessage(0)</code> here to tell your main message loop that it's time to pack up and exit the app.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>WM_PAINT</code></td>
                    <td>Windows is giving you a heads-up: "Hey, part of your window needs a fresh coat of paint!" This happens when a window becomes visible, is uncovered, or when you explicitly ask it to redraw.</td>
                    <td>Inside this message, you usually do your drawing. You'll kick things off with <code>BeginPaint</code>, use the provided drawing context (HDC) to paint your stuff, and then wrap it up with <code>EndPaint</code>. No drawing outside of this!</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><code>WM_QUIT</code></td>
                    <td>This is a special internal "game over" message. Your main message loop (<code>GetMessage</code>) uses this to know when to finally stop running and let your application close.</td>
                    <td>You actually **don't** handle this one directly in your <code>WndProc</code> function. Instead, <code>GetMessage</code> just returns 0 when it sees this, which is the signal for your program's main loop to exit. It's the loop's secret handshake to say "we're done."</td>

                    <td>You can catch this message if you want to ask the user, "Are you sure you want to quit?" before letting the window close. If they say no, you can stop it; otherwise, let <code>DefWindowProc</code> handle it.</td>

                    <td><code>WM_COMMAND</code></td>

                    <td>Check <code>wParam</code> (specifically its lower 16 bits) to figure out *which* specific menu item or control sent this message. That's how you know what action to take!</td>

                    <td>Use <code>wParam</code> to see *which* key was pressed. It'll be a virtual key code (like <code>VK_ESCAPE</code> for the Escape key or <code>VK_LEFT</code> for the left arrow). Great for game controls or shortcuts!</td>

                    <td>If you're building a text input box or need to capture actual letters, numbers, or symbols (like 'a', 'Z', '7', '!'), this is the message you'll use. <code>wParam</code> will hold the ASCII or Unicode value of the character.</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><code>WM_KEYUP</code></td>

                    <td>You might not always need this, but it's handy for things like detecting when a 'shift' key is released, or when you want to stop an action that started on key down.</td>

                    <td>This is your cue for single clicks, starting a drag-and-drop operation, or initiating any action tied to a left mouse press.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>WM_LBUTTONUP</code></td>
                    <td>The left mouse button, which was pressed, has now been released.</td>
                    <td>This usually marks the end of a click action or the completion of a drag-and-drop. You often pair this with <code>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</code>.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><code>WM_MOUSEMOVE</code></td>
                    <td>The mouse pointer just moved a tiny bit while it was over your window's client area. Get ready for a lot of these if the user is fidgety!</td>
                    <td>Great for tracking the cursor's position, creating hover effects (like highlighting a button when the mouse is over it), or drawing lines when dragging.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>WM_SIZE</code></td>
                    <td>Your window just got a makeover — someone resized it! It fires whenever the window's dimensions change.</td>
                    <td>This is where you'd adjust the layout of your elements inside the window. If you have buttons, text boxes, or images, this is where you'd make sure they reposition or resize correctly to fit the new window size.</td>

                    <td><code>WM_TIMER</code></td>
                    <td>Tick-tock! This message is sent to your window after a specific amount of time has passed, if you've set up a timer using <code>SetTimer</code>.</td>
                    <td>Perfect for anything that needs to happen regularly, like animations, checking for updates, or polling for certain conditions.</td>

                    <td><code>WM_SETCURSOR</code></td>
                    <td>The mouse pointer is hovering over your window, and Windows is asking, "What kind of cursor should I show here?"</td>
                    <td>Use this to customize the mouse cursor when it's over different parts of your window – maybe a hand over a button, or an I-beam over text.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>WM_HOTKEY</code></td>
                    <td>You pressed a specific keyboard shortcut that you've registered system-wide (meaning it works even when your app isn't the active window).</td>
                    <td>This is how you handle global shortcuts in your app, like 'Ctrl+Alt+S' to save from anywhere, or 'Win+Z' to open your app.</td>

            <h2>🧠 Pro Tip: Message Flow Logic – The Daily Grind</h2>
            <p>Imagine your app as a busy chef in a kitchen. Here's how the orders (messages) flow:</p>
            <div class="message-flow-code">
System/User event (customer places an order) →
   Windows creates a message (waiter writes it down) →
      Puts it in your message queue (on the order spike) →
         GetMessage() pulls it (chef grabs the next order) →
            TranslateMessage (optional, chef reads it, maybe translates shorthand) →
               DispatchMessage (chef sends it to the right station) →
                  WndProc handles it (the specific station cooks the dish!)
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="def-proc-info">
            <h2>💡 The Golden Rule: Don't Leave Windows Hanging!</h2>
            <p>If your <code>WndProc</code> function doesn't specifically handle a message (because you only care about certain ones), it's super important to let Windows take over. Think of it like this: if you, the chef, don't know how to make a dish, you pass it to the head chef.</p>
            <p>Always return this if you don't handle a message:</p>
            <div class="def-proc-code">
                <code>return DefWindowProc(hwnd, message, wParam, lParam);</code>
            </div>
            <p>This way, Windows handles all the default behavior for you, like closing windows, moving them around, minimizing, maximizing, and all that good stuff without you having to code it!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="optional-add-on">
            <h2>🔒 Optional Add-on: Virtual Keys (for <code>WM_KEYDOWN</code>)</h2>
            <p>Curious about those specific key codes like <code>VK_ESCAPE</code>, <code>VK_RETURN</code>, or <code>VK_LEFT</code>? They're super useful when you're checking <code>wParam</code> inside <code>WM_KEYDOWN</code> to identify exactly which key was pressed.</p>
