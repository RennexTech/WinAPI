🚀 **Welcome to the WinAPI Wormhole!**

Before we even talk abit, just understand this, WinAPI is the core of reverse engineering, period! Open any reversing tool and whatever we learn together from this repo is exactly what you will find. eg This is pestudio, you can literally see WinAPI functions that are explained in my notes appearing straight up. And if you've read through the whole repo, there's nothing new or scary over here. That's why this repo is super important.

Look at IDA dissassembler, WinAPI appears again...

Hey there am Nick and I welcome you as my Windows API adventurer! You're the lucky few who've found me. Buckle up! 

**🕵️‍♂️My Background: The Quest for WinAPI Knowledge**

Picture this: There I was, lost in the digital deserts, searching for knowledge mines containing **organized** Windows API wisdom. 🔍

What did I find? Just a bunch of dusty, outdated and long-forgotten Chinese and Russian forums. 

There was literally no one breaking this down for free in a way that made sense.

And honestly — how are we supposed to master operating systems if WinAPI itself is locked behind outdated knowledge walls and a boring Microsoft Documentation?

So, I tried opening tools like IDA Pro and Ghidra (which I still barely understand), and suddenly I was like:

“Wait… Isn’t this the same stuff from that old Charles Petzold book on WinAPI?”

While I was fighting hello world in python, 17-year-old reverse-engineering demons on Russian and Chinese forums were casually cracking slot machine binaries and chewing IDA like breakfast. 🥣💀

So I dug through outdated docs and cryptic Chinese forums to pull everything into one place — because learning shouldn’t feel like an unpaid side quest. 💎 

This repo is for: Students who are stuck 📚, curious coders 🧐, bootcamp dropouts 🏃‍♂️💨, and anyone who’s rage-searched WinAPI tutorials at 3 AM 😤🌙

I’m 24, not a master at this stuff — just someone who put in a lot of time into this, so the next Windows programmers and Reverse Engineers don’t have to suffer as much. Am here to keep the fire of Low-level burning. 🔥

**What’s inside 💻 Colorful code & visuals**
WinAPI doesn’t have to look dead or ancient. The notes use color and images so your brain stays awake.

📚 Notes that actually make sense: (I know, shocking! Clear notes, explained to the core.)

🎢 A rollercoaster ride through the weirdest parts of Windows that you'd never even thought existed.

**Prerequisites / contributions**

Basic C/C++ (ASM helps)

Interest in low-level stuff

No pressure to contribute code. If you really want to help, snacks will give me moral support to make you learning repos eg OS, TCP, and a lot that I have in store... 

Email me if you’ve got feedback or questions — there’s a lot to learn over here.

**Remember:** Every master was once a disaster. Rome wasn't built in a day, neither does a good WinAPI programmer.

Enjoy, my people!👊

Thanks for dropping by!
